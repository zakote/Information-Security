##  Paper Summary

This project includes an in-depth technical survey covering:

-  Flash Loan Attacks
-  Oracle Manipulation
-  Reentrancy
-  Miner Extractable Value (MEV)
-  Defensive techniques (Auditing, Formal Verification, Bug Bounties, etc.)
-  Experiments with real attack simulations
-  Real-world case studies (bZx, Mango Markets, Cream Finance, etc.)

##  Practical Demos (Solidity)

Each exploit is implemented in Remix-compatible Solidity with full documentation and result validation.
