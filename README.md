## 📄 Paper Summary

This project includes an in-depth technical survey covering:

- ⚠️ Flash Loan Attacks
- ⚠️ Oracle Manipulation
- ⚠️ Reentrancy
- ⚠️ Miner Extractable Value (MEV)
- ✅ Defensive techniques (Auditing, Formal Verification, Bug Bounties, etc.)
- 🧪 Experiments with real attack simulations
- 📊 Real-world case studies (bZx, Mango Markets, Cream Finance, etc.)

## 🧪 Practical Demos (Solidity)

Each exploit is implemented in Remix-compatible Solidity with full documentation and result validation.
