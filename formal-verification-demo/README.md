#  Formal Verification Demo â€” SafeBank + Slither

This demo showcases a secure Solidity smart contract (`SafeBank.sol`) and the use of [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) â€” a static analysis tool â€” to verify its safety against common vulnerabilities like **reentrancy**.

---

## ðŸ§  What This Demonstrates

-  A reentrancy-protected smart contract
-  Audit performed with Slither static analyzer
-  Verification that no critical issues exist
-  Secure coding best practices for DeFi

---

##  Contract: `SafeBank.sol`

A minimal contract that:
- Lets users deposit and withdraw ETH
- Tracks balances using a `mapping`
- Prevents reentrancy by updating state **before** calling external functions

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

    //  Update balance first (reentrancy protection)
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

    // External ETH transfer
    (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "Transfer failed");
}
 ``` 
##  Slither Audit
We used the following command to analyze the contract:

slither SafeBank.sol --print human-summary > SafeBank-slither.txt
This generates a security report in human-readable form. It checks for:

Reentrancy

Insecure patterns

Unsafe calls

Low-level bugs

 Audit Results Summary
Key findings from SafeBank-slither.txt:

 No high or medium severity issues

 Only 2 informational findings (non-critical)

 Slither confirms use of safe coding patterns

 Contract contains only 3 functions, no complex logic

| Metric               | Value                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Contracts analyzed   | 1                        |
| Functions            | 3                        |
| Reentrancy risk      |  No                     |
| Low-level call usage |  Present, but safe      |
| Safe for mainnet?    |  Reasonable confidence |
